h1. jQuery copyfriendly

A simple jQuery plugin that extracts the text from an HTML element and places it into an "invisible" text field. This makes selecting and copying the text much easier since no surrounding whitespace is copied by the browser.

The plugin works unobtrusively, so nothing happens in the absense of Javascript.

h2. Usage

Include jquery.copyfriendly.js as fire it off like this:

  $(document).ready(function(){
    $('.copyme').copyfriendly();
  });

Then mark your required elements with the specified class:

  <tr>
    <td class="copyme">Hello</td>
  </tr>

Or

  <span class="copyme">Heya</span>

h2. Options

copyfriendly() takes on parameter currently, which is optional:

  copyfriendly( {
    klass: "borderless"
  } );

The 'klass' option tells copyfriendly which CSS class to apply to the inputs generated.

h2. Sample CSS

You can make the inputs generated by copyfriendly invisible using this sample CSS:

  input.borderless {
    border: none;
  }

Do be warned that it might take a little more to align the appearance of the remaining text with the surrounding text in the document.
